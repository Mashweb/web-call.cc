# Introduction

1. Part 1 of this [_Guide_](https://tomelam.gitbook.io/mashweb/) explains how and why its author began to experiment with ideas related to the simple, easy creation of web pages and web applications.
2. Part 2 lays out the goals and possible goals for Zen and Mashweb.
3. Part 3 documents the nano framework at the heart of Zen.
4. Part 4 documents the plan, of unproven viability, for the construction of web page structures.
5. Part 5 documents the user interaction code that Zen provides to simplify the programming of web apps. Mainly these are protocols for interacting with the HTML5 APIs such as [the HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) and [the Clipboard API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API).
6. Part 6 presents some example web apps such as what a semiskilled web developer might create with [Alpha Zen](https://app.gitbook.com/@tomelam/s/mashweb/part-2-goals-of-zen/the-plan-for-alpha-zen).
7. Part 7 presents outside tools to facilitate the design and programming of Zen and [Mashweb.Club](https://mashweb.club).

## Part 3: The Key to Zen: A Nano Framework for Sequential Programming

Virtually every part of Zen involves intricately designed user interaction. This can be managed only if the asynchronous, stateless environment of JavaScript in the web page can be tamed and brought under the control of a sequential process. It is painful to say it, but it sometimes appears that most of today's web developers believe the most natural way to program user interactions is with pure event driven code. Even seasoned programmers appear to lose sight of the fact that an application that doesn't progress logically through a series of goals is just a random process. Turning complex user interactions into sequential processes by using `call/cc` is Zen's key to success.

## Part 4: Web Page Structure

## Part 5: User Interactions and the HTML5 APIs

## Part 6: Example Web Apps Built with Zen

## Part 7: Outside Tools To Help Build Zen
