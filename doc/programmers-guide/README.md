# About this book

This book is meant to be a complete guide to the Zen web framework and the Mashweb community concept. Since it is hosted by GitBook.com on their free Community plan, it must be \(can only be\) edited by its owner, although [pull requests](https://github.com/Mashweb/web-call.cc/pulls) can be issued by others. Its audience is programmers and web developers. It is meant to draw together into one document all such diverse types of digital information as exist to help programmers and web developers use, extend, and further develop the framework. Some of it should be comprehensible to many non programmers and non web developers who have only a general knowledge of computers and the web.

The main "diverse types of digital information" mentioned above that preceded this book are:

1. [the website Mashweb.Club built with Ruby on Rails](https://mashweb.club), where an estimated 1,500 visitors have registered, which is meant to be an attractive and gentle introduction to Mashweb and Zen that many people might enjoy,
2. [a white paper](https://doc.mashweb.club/whitepaper/) hosted on Mashweb.Club,
3. [a blog site](https://tomelam.blogspot.com/) that discusses some of the problems exploiting the web to the fullest,
4. [a website](https://web-call.cc) that is basically just a set of statically served demos,
5. [an old, unmaintained personal website](http://tomelam.com),
6. [the Mashweb team's forum](https://github.com/orgs/Mashweb/teams/pre-alpha-zen), invisible to all but the Mashweb team members, 

   which documents many of the important development decisions about Zen and [web-call.cc](https://web-call.cc), and

7. the [web-call.cc wiki](https://github.com/Mashweb/web-call.cc/wiki), which can be edited by Mashweb team members.

Parts of this book will replace the blog site \(\#3\) and the personal website \(\#5\).

Documenting Zen through through a [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) might have these potential benefits:

1. The documentation can be developed chapter by chapter rather than blog post by blog post and can be longer than the typical white paper.
2. The documentation can be comprehensive and coherent. A table of contents can lay out the pages even before they are written. Pages can be stubs. Stubbed pages can point to external resources to introduce their topics.
3. Versions of the book can be identified by [semantic version names](https://semver.org/), making the intent of each version apparent. \(See also [Wikipedia's entry on semantic versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning).\)
4. GitBook can be used to store all versions of a book. Not every GitHub commit must have a version number, but each version of the book should be stored in a commit and have its own tag that is just a semantic version.
5. [A two-way synchronization](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github) between GitBook and GitHub, editing based upon MarkDown, and periodic pulls from the GitHub repository backing up the book ensure that no work on the book will be lost.
