# About this book

This [_Guide_](https://tomelam.gitbook.io/mashweb/) is meant to be a complete guide to the Zen web application framework and the Mashweb community concept. Since it is hosted by [GitBook.com](https://www.gitbook.com/) on their [free Community plan](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing), it must be \(can only be\) edited by its owner, although [pull requests](https://github.com/Mashweb/web-call.cc/pulls) can be issued by others. Its audience is programmers and web developers. Some of it should be comprehensible to many non programmers and non web developers who have only a general knowledge of computers and the web.

Documenting Zen through through a [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) might have these potential benefits:

1. The documentation can be developed chapter by chapter rather than blog post by blog post and can be longer than the typical white paper.
2. The documentation can be comprehensive and coherent. A table of contents can lay out the pages even before they are written. Pages can be stubs. Stubbed pages can point to external resources to introduce their topics.
3. Versions of the book can be identified by [semantic version names](https://semver.org/), making the intent of each version apparent. \(See also [Wikipedia's entry on semantic versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning).\)
4. [A two-way synchronization](https://docs.gitbook.com/integrations/github) between GitBook and GitHub, editing based upon MarkDown, and periodic pulls from the GitHub repository backing up the book ensure that no work on the book will be lost.
5. [GitBook.com](https://www.gitbook.com/) \(and the corresponding Git repository\) can be used to store all versions of the [_Guide_](https://tomelam.gitbook.io/mashweb/). Not every Git commit must have a version number, but each version of the book should be stored in a commit and have its own tag that is just a semantic version.
