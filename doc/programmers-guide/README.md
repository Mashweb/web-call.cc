# About this book

This [_Guide_](https://tomelam.gitbook.io/mashweb/) is meant to be a complete guide to the Zen web application framework and the Mashweb community concept. Since it is hosted by [GitBook.com](https://www.gitbook.com/) on their [free Community plan](https://www.gitbook.com/pricing), it must be \(can only be\) edited by its owner, although [pull requests](https://github.com/Mashweb/web-call.cc/pulls) can be issued by others. Its audience is programmers and web developers. Some of it should be comprehensible to many non programmers and non web developers who have only a general knowledge of computers and the web.
