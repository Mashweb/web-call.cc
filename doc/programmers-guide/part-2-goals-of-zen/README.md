# Part 2: Goals \(and Possible Goals\) of Zen

Motivations and goals are not the same thing. When will Zen be complete? Or when will a _version_ of it really exist? The answer is: when its goals have been met.

In reality, though, Zen has a graded set of _possible_ goals, some imminently achievable and some just remotely believable. Part 2 will break this down. See [The Plan for Alpha Zen](https://tomelam.gitbook.io/mashweb/part-2-goals-of-zen/the-plan-for-alpha-zen).
