  Currently we have a pre-alpha Zen. It has some capabilities that a complete
  demonstration version (Alpha Zen) should have. We need a plan to develop the
  pre-alpha Zen to the Alpha Zen. This is it.

# The plan for Alpha Zen

Here are the salient points about Alpha Zen:

1. When [Alpha Zen](https://tomelam.gitbook.io/mashweb/part-2-goals-of-zen/the-plan-for-alpha-zen) is released, [Mashweb.Club](https://mashweb.club) will host it and be completely revamped. At the same time, [the white paper](https://doc.mashweb.club/whitepaper/) will be moved into this [_Guide_](https://tomelam.gitbook.io/mashweb/), which will  be released along with [Alpha Zen](https://tomelam.gitbook.io/mashweb/part-2-goals-of-zen/the-plan-for-alpha-zen). Code from [web-call.cc](https://web-call.cc/) will be cherry-picked and installed on [Mashweb.Club](https://mashweb.club/). Prior to the release of [Alpha Zen](https://tomelam.gitbook.io/mashweb/part-2-goals-of-zen/the-plan-for-alpha-zen), [web-call.cc](https://web-call.cc/) will be for experimenting and providing early glimpses of the Zen framework.
2. Poor, innocent nontechnical visitors will be the target audience of the homepage and a section of Mashweb.Club.  A section of Mashweb.Club with a target audience of programmers will be clearly marked "Advanced".  The purpose of Mashweb.Club will be to inspire interest in using and further developing the Zen framework.
3. Mashweb.Club will allow a visitor to create web pages using any of the most common responsive web design patterns \(also called multi-device layout patterns\).  See [Responsive Web Design Patterns on developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/patterns), \(bit.ly/web-design-patterns\).   These pages will not be based upon templates.  The DOM structure of the page will be live edited, then persisted \(only for registered users\).  This editing will be described in a separate team discussion here.
4. A registered user will be able to upload a Scheme file with DOM and JavaScript extensions and run it inside the web page he creates.
5. A visitor will be able to create very simple web apps using a visual program editor.  See the barely begun web-call.cc subproject \([web-call.cc Demo \#3: Zen visual program editor](https://web-call.cc/visual-programming.html).
6. Using the HTML5 Drag and Drop API, a visitor will be able to drag and drop text and other types of data from outside the web browser into a Zen web page.
7. Using the HTML5 Asynchronous Clipboard API, a visitor will be able to copy text and other types of data from outside the web browser into a Zen web page.
8. A registered user will be able to persist any of his Zen web pages.

There are many important details to the DOM editing \(point \#3\), covered separately in [Part 4: Web Page Structure](https://tomelam.gitbook.io/mashweb/part-4-web-page-structure).
