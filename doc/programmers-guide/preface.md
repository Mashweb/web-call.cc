# Preface

This book exists because I found myself trying to explain the same ideas again and again and wished I had organized them in a coherent and organized way. Some of my explanations got lost along the way, too. Having a structure to hold them should help my ideas and writing by providing pigeon holes, reference points, and sign posts by which to mark the development of vague ideas as they become more tangible and useful.

Prior to starting to write this book, I tried presenting my ideas on [tomelam.blogspot.com](https://tomelam.blogspot.com), [tomelam.com](https://tomelam.com), and [mashweb.club](https://mashweb.club). None of those venues seemed right for a standalone, easily extensible, catalogue of my ideas on Zen and Mashweb. I hope and expect that the present book will finally coalesce my words about Zen and Mashweb into one manageable, comprehensible unit.
