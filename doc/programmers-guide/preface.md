# Preface

This book exists because I found myself trying to explain the same ideas again and again and wished I had organized them in a coherent and organized way. Some of my explanations got lost along the way, too. Having a structure to hold them should help my ideas and writing by providing pigeon holes, reference points, and sign posts by which to mark the development of vague ideas as they become more tangible and useful.
