# Notes on Asynchronous JavaScript

Here I will keep links and key points related to asynchronous JavaScript.

## RxJS

> What is RxJS? RxJS is the reactive extensions library for JavaScript. It's a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. RxJS 6 is a rewrite of Reactive-Extensions/RxJS with better performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface. Version 7 is currently in public beta, but is currently used by Google in production. To learn more about RxJS, please come to the conference or visit the documentation at rxjs.dev.
