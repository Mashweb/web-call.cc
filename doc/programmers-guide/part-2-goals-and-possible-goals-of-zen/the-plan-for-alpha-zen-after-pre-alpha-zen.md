# The-plan-for-Alpha-Zen-\(after-Pre-Alpha-Zen\)

Here are the salient features of Alpha Zen \(after Pre-Alpha Zen\):

1. Code from [web-call.cc](https://web-call.cc/) will be cherry-picked and installed on [Mashweb.Club](https://mashweb.club/).  web-call.cc is for experimenting and providing early glimpses of the Zen framework.
2. Poor, innocent nontechnical visitors will be the target audience of the homepage and a section of Mashweb.Club.  A section of Mashweb.Club with a target audience of programmers will be clearly marked "Advanced".  The purpose of Mashweb.Club will be to inspire interest in using and further developing the Zen framework.
3. Mashweb.Club will allow a visitor to create web pages using any of the most common responsive web design patterns \(also called multi-device layout patterns\).  See [Responsive Web Design Patterns on developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/patterns), \(bit.ly/web-design-patterns\).   These pages will not be based upon templates.  The DOM structure of the page will be live edited, then persisted \(only for registered users\).  This editing will be described in a separate team discussion here.
4. A registered user will be able to upload a Scheme file for Biwascheme and run it inside the web page he creates.  See [biwascheme.org](https://www.biwascheme.org/).
5. A visitor will be able to create very simple web apps using a visual program editor.  See the barely begun web-call.cc subproject \([web-call.cc Demo \#3: Zen visual program editor](https://web-call.cc/visual-programming.html).
6. Using the HTML5 Drag and Drop API, a visitor will be able to drag and drop text and other types of data from outside the web browser into a Zen web page.
7. Using the HTML5 Asynchronous Clipboard API, a visitor will be able to copy text and other types of data from outside the web browser into a Zen web page.
8. A registered user will be able to persist any of his Zen web pages.

That's all I can think of right now. I think that's all there is to my concept of Alpha Zen. Of course there are many important details to the DOM editing \(feature \#3\). I will try to give those details later today \(about 10 to 12 hours from now\).
