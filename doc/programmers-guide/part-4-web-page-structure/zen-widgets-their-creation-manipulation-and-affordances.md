# Zen Widgets: Their Creation, Manipulation, and Affordances

Around 2007, it was possible to create rich web apps using the Dojo Toolkit \(not to be confused with the Dojo reboot post Dojo 1.x\). See [dojotoolkit.org](https://dojotoolkit.org/). See the [Dojo Toolkit Demo Index](http://demos.dojotoolkit.org/demos/). The widgets that Dojo Toolkit provided can probably easily be added to a Zen web page, cloned, placed, moved around, etc.
