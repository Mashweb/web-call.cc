  Several means of team communication, source control, and planning have been
  adopted. They are mentioned here.

# Part 9: Project management

## Source Control

1. Front end, including web pages served as static resources: [https://github.com/Mashweb/web-call.cc](https://github.com/Mashweb/web-call.cc)
2. Back end: currently none. The web pages containing the front end code are simply served as static resources by a web server like Apache 2, Nginx, or Hunchentoot. At some point a Hunchentoot or Ruby on Rails backend will be put in place. It will provide authentication and authorisation for access to the back end database.
3. Back end database: a special purpose, Common Lisp based RESTful web service exists to serve HTML DOMs stored as s-expressions: [https://github.com/Mashweb/ZenDatabase](https://github.com/Mashweb/ZenDatabase)
4. Associated Ruby on Rails based "non technical" club website: [https://github.com/Mashweb/mashweb.club](https://github.com/Mashweb/mashweb.club)
5. Static web pages served by GitHub Pages and accessed by the subdomain doc.mashweb.club, containing some demos and documentation \(mostly the white paper\): [https://github.com/Mashweb/mashweb.github.io](https://github.com/Mashweb/mashweb.github.io)
6. WordPress pages on the subdomain blog.mashweb.club: accessed via a WordPress admin login.
